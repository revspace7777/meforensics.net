# Forensic Engineering & Cause of Origin Investigation

## The Science of Structural Failure

Forensic engineering is not just about identifying damage—it is about determining the *when*, *how*, and *why* of a structural failure. At ME Forensics, we apply rigorous engineering principles to investigate property damage, providing unbiased, scientifically defensible conclusions that stand up to scrutiny.

## Our Forensic Methodology

We follow a systematic protocol for every investigation, ensuring consistency and reliability:

1.  **Site Inspection:** Detailed visual examination and photographic documentation of the loss location.
2.  **fact Gathering:** Review of weather data, maintenance records, and construction documents.
3.  **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT):** Utilization of thermal imaging, moisture meters, and floor elevation surveys to gather data without causing further damage.
4.  **Analysis:** application of engineering mechanics and code requirements to the observed conditions.
5.  **Reporting:** Production of a clear, concise, and sealed engineering report outlining findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

## Common Investigations

*   **Roof Damage Assessment:** Distinguishing between acute wind/hail damage and long-term wear/tear or installation errors.
*   **Water Intrusion:** Tracing leak pathways through building envelopes, stucco, windows, and roofs.
*   **Structural Settlement:** Differential foundation movement analysis using floor level surveys and soil conceptual models.
*   **Construction Defects:** Identifying deviations from the Florida Building Code and approved plans.
*   **Fire & Impact Damage:** Assessing structural integrity after vehicular impact or fire events.

## Who We Serve

*   **Insurance Carriers:** providing prompt, accurate Cause & Origin reports.
*   **Attorneys:** Delivering expert opinions for construction litigation.
*   **Property Owners/HOAs:** Helping stakeholders understand the true condition of their assets.
