# Disaster Response & Structural Assessment

## Rapid Response When it Matters Most

When disaster strikes—whether it's a hurricane, fire, or vehicle impact—time is of the essence. Property owners and insurers need immediate answers: *Is the structure safe? Is it salvageable?*

ME Forensics provides 24/7 emergency response services to assess structural stability and secure dangerous sites.

## Our Services Include

### Post-Hurricane Evaluation

*   **Roof Integrity:** assessingshingles, tiles, and metal roofing systems for storm-created openings.

### Fire Damage Assessment
*   Evaluation of structural framing (trusses, beams, columns) after fire exposure.
*   Determination of char depth and remaining load capacity.

### Vehicle Impact
*   Immediate shoring recommendations.
*   Assessment of impact force transfer to foundations and adjacent walls.

### Sinkhole & Settlement
