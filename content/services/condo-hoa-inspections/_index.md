# Condo Milestone Inspections (SB 4D / SB 154)

## Ensuring Structural Integrity for Florida's Condos

In response to the Surfside tragedy, Florida legislature enacted strict requirements for aging condominiums. ME Forensics provides comprehensive **Milestone Inspections** to help Associations meet these statutory deadlines and ensure resident safety.

## What is a Milestone Inspection?

A structural inspection of a building's primary structural systems to confirm its life-safety and adequacy.

### **Phase 1 Inspection**
*   **Requirement:** Visual examination of habitable and non-habitable areas by a Licensed Professional Engineer (P.E.) or Architect.
*   **Goal:** To detect "substantial structural deterioration."
*   **Outcome:** If no substantial deterioration is found, the inspection is complete, and a sealed report is issued to the Building Official.

### **Phase 2 Inspection**
*   **Trigger:** Required ONLY if "substantial structural deterioration" is identified in Phase 1.
*   **Scope:** May involve destructive or non-destructive testing (NDT) to determine the extent of the damage.
*   **Outcome:** A detailed remediation plan and structural assessment.

## When is it Required?
*   **30 Years:** For buildings 3 stories or higher.
*   **25 Years:** If the building is located within 3 miles of the coastline.
*   **Every 10 Years:** Thereafter.
