# Advanced Drone & ROV Inspections

## Seeing the Unseen

Access is often the biggest challenge in forensic engineering. Steep roofs, tall towers, and submerged structures present safety risks and logistical hurdles. ME Forensics utilizes advanced unmanned systems to gather critical data safely and efficiently.

## Aerial Drone Services (UAV)

**FAA Part 107 Certified Pilots**

*   **High-Resolution 4K Imagery:** Capture detailed photos of roof coverings, flashing, and chimneys without walking on the surface (preventing further damage).
*   **Towers & Tall Structures:** Inspect cellular towers, church steeples, and high-rise facades.
*   **Site Mapping:** Create orthomosaic maps of large loss locations for documentation.

## Underwater ROV Services

**Remotely Operated Vehicles**

We deploy underwater drones to inspect submerged infrastructure, eliminating the need for divers in hazardous waters.

*   **Seawall Inspections:** assess toe scour, panel cracking, and cap rotation.
*   **Dock & Piling Assessment:** Check for marine borer damage and concrete spalling below the waterline.
*   **Bridge Substructures:** evaluate scouring and pile integrity.

## Why Use Drones?
1.  **Safety:** Keeps personnel off dangerous roofs and out of hazardous water.
2.  **Speed:** rapid data collection covers large areas quickly.
3.  **Documentation:** Provides high-definition video evidence that can be reviewed repeatedly.
