# Miami Condo Milestone Inspections

## Meeting the 25-Year Coastal Requirement

Miami is the epicenter of Florida's condo safety legislation. Due to the proximity to the saltwater coastline, many buildings in Miami-Dade County are subject to the stricter **25-year milestone inspection** requirement, rather than the standard 30-year timeline.

## Challenges for Miami Condos

Miami's high-rise architecture faces constant aggressive environmental factors:
1.  **Chloride Intrusion:** Salt spray penetrates concrete, causing rebar to rust and expand, leading to spalling.
2.  **Settlement:** Heavy structures built on reclaimed land or porous limestone need careful foundation monitoring.
3.  **Wind Loading:** High-rise towers must withstand significant wind pressures during hurricanes.

## Our Miami Inspection Process

ME Forensics provides thorough Phase 1 visual inspections. If "substantial structural deterioration" is suspected, we seamlessly transition to Phase 2, utilizing:
- **Concrete Coring & Petrographic Analysis:** To determine chloride content and concrete strength.
- **GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar):** To locate rebar and post-tension cables without destruction.
- **Thermal Imaging:** To find delaminated stucco high up on tower facades using drones.

## Compliance and Peace of Mind

We help Miami associations not just "pass" an inspection, but truly understand the health of their building, allowing for accurate reserve studies and maintenance planning.
