# Seawall & Marine Inspections in Miami

## Protecting Waterfront Assets

Miami's property value is inextricably linked to the water. Yet, thousands of miles of seawalls in Coral Gables, North Miami, and the Venetian Islands are nearing the end of their service lives. ME Forensics provides specialized marine inspections to assess structural health below the waterline.

## Common Failures Evaluated

*   **Toe Scour:** Erosion of the bay bottom at the base of the seawall, leading to rotation and collapse.
*   **Tie-Back Corrosion:** Failure of the steel rods anchoring the wall to the land, causing the wall to bow outward.
*   **Cap Crack Separation:** Signs that the concrete cap is moving independently of the panels.

## Advanced Underwater Technology

We utilize **Underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles)** to inspect seawalls and pilings.
*   **Zero Visibility Capabilities:** Our ROVs use sonar assist to navigate murky canal waters.
*   **Safety:** Eliminates the risk of putting divers in water with currents or marine life.
*   **Documentation:** Provides 4K video evidence of cracks, spalling, and marine borer activity.

## For Buyers and HOAs
A seawall replacement can cost thousands of dollars per linear foot. A pre-purchase or scheduled maintenance inspection by a licensed engineer is your best defense against unexpected multi-million dollar assessments.
