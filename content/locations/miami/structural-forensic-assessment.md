# Miami Structural Forensic Assessments

## Beyond the Surface

In Miami's dynamic real estate market, surface repairs often mask deeper structural issues. Whether you are investigating a crack in a historic Art Deco hotel in South Beach or settling in a new construction home in Doral, ME Forensics provides the engineering analysis needed to understand the root cause.

## Structural Issues Unique to Miami

*   **Coral Rock Foundations:** Miami's porous limestone substrate can lead to unique settlement patterns, especially when groundwater tables fluctuate.
*   **Concrete Spalling:** High heat and humidity accelerate the "cancer" of rusting rebar within concrete beams and columns.
*   **Unpermitted Additions:** Many Miami properties have historical modifications that may not meet current load path requirements.

## Our Assessment Services

*   **Foundation Analysis:** Using floor elevation surveys (Manometer/Zip-Level) to map differential movement to the millimeter.
*   **Load Capacity Checks:** Calculating if a roof or floor system can support new HVAC units or change of occupancy.
*   **Cracking Diagnostics:** Monitoring crack gauges to determine if structural movement is active or dormant.
