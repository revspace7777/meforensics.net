# Miami Flood vs. Wind Determinations

## The Crucial Question in Hurricane Claims

In Miami, where hurricanes frequently bring both Category 4+ winds and massive storm surges, the "concurrent causation" debate is central to insurance recovery. Policyholders often face a complex web of wind policies (covering uplift/racking) and flood policies (covering rising water).

ME Forensics provides the scientific clarity needed to distinguish between these two forces.

## Our Forensic Approach

We investigate the **mechanism of failure** to allocate damage correctly:

*   **Wind Damage Indicators:**
    *   Uplifted roof tiles near eaves and corners (high pressure zones).
    *   Impact damage from airborne debris high on the structure.
    *   Window failure from positive/negative pressure differentials.

*   **Flood Damage Indicators:**
    *   Waterlines and scour marks on the exterior.
    *   Hydrostatic pressure damage to lower foundations.
    *   Damage confined to elevations below the recorded storm surge.

## Local Data Analysis
We overlay site-specific forensic evidence with:
*   NOAA tidal gauge data for Biscayne Bay.
*   Anemometer readings from Miami International Airport and local stations.
*   ASCE 7 wind contour maps.

This triangulation of data creates a defensible Cause & Origin report for claims in flood zones A and V along Miami Beach and Key Biscayne.
