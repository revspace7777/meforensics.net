# Forensic Engineering in Miami, Florida

## Serving Miami-Dade County's Unique Infrastructure

Miami requires a specialized approach to forensic engineering. Between the high-density coastal construction, the legacy of Hurricane Andrew, and the strict requirements of the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ), generic engineering solutions do not suffice.

ME Forensics provides localized expertise for Miami's condos, commercial properties, and residential homes. We understand the specific challenges posed by:
- **Salt-Air Corrosion:** Accelerating spalling in reinforced concrete structures along Brickell, South Beach, and Sunny Isles.
- **Limestone Substrates:** Dealing with the porous nature of Florida's bedrock and its impact on foundations.
- **Code Compliance:** Navigating the specific nuances of the Miami-Dade Building Code.

## Key Services in Miami

- **Condo Milestone Inspections:** Helping HOAs in Aventura, Bal Harbour, and downtown Miami meet the 25/30-year statutory deadlines.
- **Expert Witness Testimony:** Supporting Miami legal teams with Daubert-qualified structural opinions.
- **Seawall & Marine Inspections:** Evaluating thousands of miles of canal and bayfront infrastructure.

## Ready to Mobilize
From our strategic position, we can deploy to any site in Miami-Dade County within hours for emergency assessments.
