# The Structural Expert Witness: Bridging Science and Law

In complex construction litigation or insurance disputes, the "trier of fact" (judge or jury) rarely has an engineering background. The role of the Expert Witness is to translate complex technical data into understandable, credible evidence.

## Qualification Standards (Daubert)
In Florida (and federal courts), experts are held to the **Daubert Standard**. This requires that:
1.  The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data.
2.  The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods.
3.  The witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

**ME Forensics engineers are Daubert-qualified**, meaning our methodology has withstood judicial scrutiny.

## What an Expert Witness Does

### 1. Forensic Investigation
Before testimony begins, the expert must gather facts. This involves site inspections, code review, and structural calculations to form an opinion.

### 2. The Expert Report
A written report is produced, detailing the findings. This document often serves as the roadmap for the entire legal strategy. It must be unbiased, thorough, and cited.

### 3. Deposition
The opposing counsel will question the expert under oath. A good expert remains calm, sticks to the science, and cannot be "tricked" into conceding points that are scientifically invalid.

### 4. Trial Testimony
The capstone is presenting the case to a jury. Using visual aids, models, and plain language, the expert explains *why* a structure failed or *why* a construction defect exists.

## Credibility is Currency
An expert's only currency is their credibility. At ME Forensics, we never act as "hired guns." We advocate for the data. Our opinions remain the same regardless of who is paying the bill—a standard that ultimately serves our clients best by providing unassailable testimony.
