# The Definitive Guide to Milestone Inspections

Following the tragic collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida (2021), the state legislature passed Senate Bill 4D and subsequent amendments in Senate Bill 154. These laws fundamentally changed how rigorous structural maintenance is regulated for condominiums and cooperatives.

## Who is Affected?
The law applies to all condominium and cooperative associations buildings that are:
1.  **Three stories** or higher in height.
2.  **30 years old** (if inland) or **25 years old** (if within 3 miles of the coastline).

## Phase 1: The Visual Inspection
The Phase 1 milestone inspection must be performed by a licensed architect or engineer. It is a visual examination of the habitable and non-habitable areas of the building, including the major structural components.

**Key Goal:** To determine if there is **"substantial structural deterioration."**

*   *Note:* This does not include minor cracks, normal settlement, or shrinkage. It refers to distress that negatively affects the building's general structural condition and integrity.

## Phase 2: Testing and Analysis
If Phase 1 identifies substantial structural deterioration, a Phase 2 inspection is required. This phase is more invasive and data-driven.

Common tests include:
*   **Destructive Testing:** Removing stucco or concrete to examine rebar condition.
*   **Non-Destructive Testing:** Using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) or impact echo testing.

## Timelines and Deadlines
For buildings that reached 30 years of age before July 1, 2022, the initial milestone inspection must be completed before **December 31, 2024**.

## The Engineer's Role
