# Hail vs. Wind: The Forensic Distinction

After a storm, a roof may look "damaged" to the untrained eye, but the specific characteristics of that damage determine whether it is a covered loss under an insurance policy. Forensic engineers are the arbiters of these technical distinctions.

## Hail Damage: The "Bruise"
Hail damage is impact damage. It is random, directional, and creates specific localized failure points.

**Signs of Hail:**
*   **Granule Loss:** Circular pits where granules are dislodged, exposing the asphalt mat.
*   **Mat Fracture:** A "soft spot" or bruise that can be felt by touch, indicating the fiberglass mat has broken.
*   **Spatter Marks:** "Clean" spots on oxidized metals (vents, gutters) caused by hail impact.

## Wind Damage: The "Lift"
Wind damage is caused by uplift pressure breaking the adhesive seal of the shingle.

**Signs of Wind:**
*   **Creasing:** A horizontal line across the top of a shingle tab where it has flapped repeatedly in the wind.
*   **Tearing:** Shingles completely ripped off the roof, usually near corners or eaves where pressure is highest.
*   **Debris Impact:** Punctures or gouges from flying branches.

## The "Wear and Tear" Confusion
Granule loss over time is normal. This "baldness" is often mistaken for hail damage. Similarly, unsealed shingles may be due to poor installation (high-nailing) rather than wind.

**Forensic Analysis:**
Our engineers use weather data, microscopic analysis, and test squares (N/S/E/W slopes) to map the damage and provide a definitive Cause & Origin report, separating storm damage from age-related deterioration.
